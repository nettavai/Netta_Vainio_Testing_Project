> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- It gave me a lot of practical experience to better understand the theoretical part of the course. At first, I thought the assignment would be too difficult for me, but the instructions were clear and guided me step by step through the entire task.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I followed the structure provided by the instructor and created modular test cases for each page (Login, Register, Project, Issue). I used Robot Framework syntax and kept variables separate for reusability. For each action, I thought in terms of expected behavior and edge cases, then documented positive and negative test flows clearly.

    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - Yes, tools like TestRail, Zephyr (for JIRA), or even Excel/Google Sheets with proper versioning can be useful in collaborative environments. For style, BDD (Behavior Driven Development) using Gherkin syntax helps non-technical stakeholders understand test cases more easily.   


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used **Visual Studio Code** with Robot Framework, which made it easier to format, lint, and organize test scripts.

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I initially struggled to understand the overall assignment. However, the assignment itself did not cause any major trouble. To overcome my confusion, I watched the provided video several times and paused or rewound certain parts to make sure I fully understood each step.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I didn’t face major issues, though I always have some difficulties updating repositories with Visual Studio Code, and I often forget the process between courses. Initially, I had trouble syncing changes between branches. I’ve used GitHub before in academic projects and open-source contributions, but this was my first time integrating it with test scripts.
      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I would continue using **Robot Framework** for its simplicity and keyword-driven approach, especially for testers without deep programming experience. However, if more speed and modern JavaScript integration is needed, **Cypress** would be my next choice due to its rich developer tooling and fast test execution.


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Good problem-solving and communication skills.
- Basic coding skills (Python, Java, or similar)
- Robot Framework
- Jira, Confluence, Jenkins
- Knowledge of tools like Selenium, Cypress, or Postman.
- Experience with Agile teams is a plus.


## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- **Technical skills**: API testing, Git CI/CD integration, advanced Selenium with Python, load testing tools like JMeter or Locust  
- **Soft skills**: Critical thinking, communication, time management, documentation, and team collaboration



## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- Yes, absolutely. This project bridged the gap between theory and practice for me. Writing structured test cases, thinking about test data, simulating user behavior, and reporting bugs felt like working in a real QA role. It helped me understand the importance of detailed planning, clear documentation, and test repeatability. I especially appreciated the emphasis on writing both positive and negative cases, which pushed me to think critically.
